# RCES Final Project
My final project repository for RCES

### Topic: 
Why is the U.S. running out of water?

### Datasets:
drought:https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?conus \
precipitation:ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/cpc_us_precip/precip.V1.0.mon.mean.nc (from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.unified.html#detail) \
temperature: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/statewide/time-series/2/tmax/ann/12/2010-2020 \
reservoir: USGS \
streams flow: USGS

### Summary: 
Due to climate change, some places are undergoing extreme conditions that wet places are getting wetter, whereas dry places are getting drier. In the U.S., some states are facing water shortage problems becasue precipitation is decreasing and temperature is raising which decrease freshwater supply. Consequently, we will study the correlation between drought and water resources, such as streams and rivers flow, reservoirs level, etc.
